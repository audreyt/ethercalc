3. Distribution Obligations.

3.1 Application of License.

The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms 
of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of 
Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version 
of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License 
with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms 
on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License 
or the recipients’ rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document 
offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.

3.2 Availability of Source Code.

Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available in 
Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable 
version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made 
an Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution 
Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it 
initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that 
particular Modification has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible 
for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic 
Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.

3.3 Description of Modifications.

You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a file documenting the 
changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include 
a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from 
Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial 
Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or 
related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.

3.4 Intellectual Property Matters

(a) Third Party Claims.

If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party’s intellectual property 
rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 
or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled "LEGAL" 
which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a 
recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the 
Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly 
modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take 
other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably 
calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.

(b) Contributor APIs.

If Contributor’s Modifications include an application programming interface and Contributor 
has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, 
Contributor must also include this information in the LEGAL file.

(c) Representations.

Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor 
believes that Contributor’s Modifications are Contributor’s original creation(s) and/or 
Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.

3.5 Required Notices.

You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code. If it is not 
possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then 
You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a user 
would be likely to look for such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s) 
You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. You must 
also duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code where You describe 
recipients’ rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, 
and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or 
more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not 
on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear 
than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, 
and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any 
liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, 
support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

3.6 Distribution of Executable Versions.

You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 
3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the 
Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, 
including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 
3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, 
related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients’ rights relating to 
the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or ownership 
rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, 
provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for 
the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient’s rights in the 
Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the 
Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any 
terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer, 
Original Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer, 
Original Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer, 
Original Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.

3.7 Larger Works.

You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the 
terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You 
must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to 
some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: 
(a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the 
limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file 
described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. 
Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be 
sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

5. Application of this License.

This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit 
A and to related Covered Code.

6. Versions of the License.

6.1 New Versions.

Socialtext, Inc. ("Socialtext") may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from 
time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.

6.2 Effect of New Versions.

Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always 
continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered 
Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Socialtext. No one 
other than Socialtext has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created 
under this License.

6.3 Derivative Works.

If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do in order to 
apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), You must (a) 
rename Your license so that the phrases "Socialtext", "CPAL" or any confusingly similar phrase 
do not appear in your license (except to note that your license differs from this License) and 
(b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license contains terms which differ from 
the CPAL. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Developer, Original Code or 
Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be 
modifications of this License.)

7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, 
EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS 
FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK 
AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE 
DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ORIGINAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER 
CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER 
OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS 
AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

8. TERMINATION.

8.1 This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to 
comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the 
breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive any 
termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond 
the termination of this License shall survive.

8.2 If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declatory 
judgment actions) against Initial Developer, Original Developer or a Contributor (the Initial 
Developer, Original Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to 
as "Participant") alleging that:

(a) such Participant’s Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then 
any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this 
License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 
60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually 
agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such 
Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version 
against such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment 
arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is 
not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 
automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above.

(b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant’s Contributor Version, 
directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such Participant 
under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, 
sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that Participant.

8.3 If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that such 
Participant’s Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim 
is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement 
litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 
2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or 
license.

8.4 In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user license agreements 
(excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any distributor 
hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.

9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, 
OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ORIGINAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR 
ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON 
FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, 
WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, 
OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF 
THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR 
DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY’S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW 
PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF 
INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), 
consisting of "commercial computer software" and "commercial computer software documentation," as 
such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 
C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered 
Code with only those rights set forth herein.

11. MISCELLANEOUS.

This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision 
of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent 
necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by California law provisions 
(except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law 
provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of, or an entity 
chartered or registered to do business in the United States of America, any litigation relating to 
this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District 
of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California, with the losing party 
responsible for costs, including without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees 
and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International 
Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a 
contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.

12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

As between Initial Developer, Original Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible 
for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under 
this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer, Original Developer and Contributors to 
distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be 
deemed to constitute any admission of liability.

13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.

Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as Multiple-Licensed. 
Multiple-Licensed means that the Initial Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered 
Code under Your choice of the CPAL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified by the Initial 
Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.

14. ADDITIONAL TERM: ATTRIBUTION

(a) As a modest attribution to the organizer of the development of the Original Code ("Original 
Developer"), in the hope that its promotional value may help justify the time, money and effort 
invested in writing the Original Code, the Original Developer may include in Exhibit B 
("Attribution Information") a requirement that each time an Executable and Source Code or a Larger 
Work is launched or initially run (which includes initiating a session), a prominent display of 
the Original Developer’s Attribution Information (as defined below) must occur on the graphic user 
interface employed by the end user to access such Covered Code (which may include display on a 
splash screen), if any. The size of the graphic image should be consistent with the size of the 
other elements of the Attribution Information. If the access by the end user to the Executable and 
Source Code does not create a graphic user interface for access to the Covered Code, this 
obligation shall not apply. If the Original Code displays such Attribution Information in a 
particular form (such as in the form of a splash screen, notice at login, an "about" display, or 
dedicated attribution area on user interface screens), continued use of such form for that 
Attribution Information is one way of meeting this requirement for notice.

(b) Attribution information may only include a copyright notice, a brief phrase, graphic image and 
a URL ("Attribution Information") and is subject to the Attribution Limits as defined below. For 
these purposes, prominent shall mean display for sufficient duration to give reasonable notice to 
the user of the identity of the Original Developer and that if You include Attribution Information 
or similar information for other parties, You must ensure that the Attribution Information for the 
Original Developer shall be no less prominent than such Attribution Information or similar 
information for the other party. For greater certainty, the Original Developer may choose to 
specify in Exhibit B below that the above attribution requirement only applies to an Executable 
and Source Code resulting from the Original Code or any Modification, but not a Larger Work. The 
intent is to provide for reasonably modest attribution, therefore the Original Developer cannot 
require that You display, at any time, more than the following information as Attribution 
Information: (a) a copyright notice including the name of the Original Developer; (b) a word or 
one phrase (not exceeding 10 words); (c) one graphic image provided by the Original Developer; and 
(d) a URL (collectively, the "Attribution Limits").

(c) If Exhibit B does not include any Attribution Information, then there are no requirements for 
You to display any Attribution Information of the Original Developer.

(d) You acknowledge that all trademarks, service marks and/or trade names contained within the 
Attribution Information distributed with the Covered Code are the exclusive property of their 
owners and may only be used with the permission of their owners, or under circumstances otherwise 
permitted by law or as expressly set out in this License.

15. ADDITIONAL TERM: NETWORK USE.
The term "External Deployment" means the use, distribution, or communication of the Original Code 
or Modifications in any way such that the Original Code or Modifications may be used by anyone 
other than You, whether those works are distributed or communicated to those persons or made 
available as an application intended for use over a network. As an express condition for the grants 
of license hereunder, You must treat any External Deployment by You of the Original Code or 
Modifications as a distribution under section 3.1 and make Source Code available under Section 3.2.

EXHIBIT A. Common Public Attribution License Version 1.0.

"The contents of this file are subject to the Common Public Attribution License Version 1.0 (the 
"License"); you may not use this file except in compliance with the License. You may obtain a copy 
of the License at _____________. The License is based on the Mozilla Public License Version 1.1 but 
Sections 14 and 15 have been added to cover use of software over a computer network and provide for 
limited attribution for the Original Developer. In addition, Exhibit A has been modified to be 
consistent with Exhibit B.

Software distributed under the License is distributed on an "AS IS" basis, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY 
KIND, either express or implied. See the License for the specific language governing rights and 
limitations under the License.

The Original Code is______________________.

The Original Developer is not the Initial Developer and is __________. If left blank, the Original 
Developer is the Initial Developer.

The Initial Developer of the Original Code is ____________. All portions of the code written by 
___________ are Copyright (c) _____. All Rights Reserved.

Contributor ______________________.

Alternatively, the contents of this file may be used under the terms of the _____ license (the 
[___] License), in which case the provisions of [______] License are applicable instead of those 
above.

If you wish to allow use of your version of this file only under the terms of the [____] License 
and not to allow others to use your version of this file under the CPAL, indicate your decision by 
deleting the provisions above and replace them with the notice and other provisions required by 
the [___] License. If you do not delete the provisions above, a recipient may use your version of 
this file under either the CPAL or the [___] License."

[NOTE: The text of this Exhibit A may differ slightly from the text of the notices in the Source 
Code files of the Original Code. You should use the text of this Exhibit A rather than the text 
found in the Original Code Source Code for Your Modifications.]

EXHIBIT B. Attribution Information

When the TableEditor is producing and/or controlling the display the Graphic Image must be
displayed on the screen visible to the user in a manner comparable to that in the 
Original Code. The Attribution Phrase must be displayed as a "tooltip" or "hover-text" for
that image. The image must be linked to the Attribution URL so as to access that page
when clicked. If the user interface includes a prominent "about" display which includes
factual prominent attribution in a form similar to that in the "about" display included
with the Original Code, including Socialtext copyright notices and URLs, then the image
need not be linked to the Attribution URL but the "tool-tip" is still required.

Attribution Copyright Notice:

 Copyright (C) 2009 Socialtext, Inc.
 All Rights Reserved.

Attribution Phrase (not exceeding 10 words): SocialCalc

Attribution URL: http://www.socialcalc.org

Graphic Image: The contents of the sc-logo.gif file in the Original Code or
a suitable replacement from http://www.socialcalc.org/licenses specified as
being for SocialCalc.

Display of Attribution Information is required in Larger Works which are defined 
in the CPAL as a work which combines Covered Code or portions thereof with code 
not governed by the terms of the CPAL.

    organization, to others outside of your company or organization.

    "Distributor Fee" means any fee that you charge for Distributing
    this Package or providing support for this Package to another
    party.  It does not mean licensing fees.

any non-standard features, executables, or modules, and provided that
you do at least ONE of the following:

    (a)  make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder
    of the Standard Version, under the Original License, so that the
    Copyright Holder may include your modifications in the Standard
    Version.

    (b)  ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not
    prevent the user installing or running the Standard Version. In
    addition, the Modified Version must bear a name that is different

Distribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version 
or Modified Versions without the Source

(5)  You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without
the Source, provided that you include complete instructions on how to
get the Source of the Standard Version.  Such instructions must be
valid at the time of your distribution.  If these instructions, at any
time while you are carrying out such distribution, become invalid, you
must provide new instructions on demand or cease further distribution.
If you provide valid instructions or cease distribution within thirty
days after you become aware that the instructions are invalid, then
you do not forfeit any of your rights under this license.

(6)  You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without
the Source, provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect to
the Source of the Modified Version.


Aggregating or Linking the Package 

(7)  You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or
Modified Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting
aggregation provided that you do not charge a licensing fee for the
Package.  Distributor Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for other
components in the aggregation are permitted. The terms of this license
apply to the use and Distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions
as included in the aggregation.

(8) You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with
other works, to embed the Package in a larger work of your own, or to
build stand-alone binary or bytecode versions of applications that
include the Package, and Distribute the result without restriction,
provided the result does not expose a direct interface to the Package.


Items That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version 

(9) Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that
merely extend or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves, cause
the Package to be a Modified Version.  In addition, such works are not
considered parts of the Package itself, and are not subject to the
terms of this license.


General Provisions

Modified Versions is governed by this Artistic License. By using,

use, modify, or distribute the Package, if you do not accept this

Version made by someone other than you, you are nevertheless required

patent claims licensable by the Copyright Holder that are necessarily
infringed by the Package. If you institute patent litigation
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim) against any party alleging
that the Package constitutes direct or contributory patent
infringement, then this Artistic License to you shall terminate on the
date that such litigation is filed.
