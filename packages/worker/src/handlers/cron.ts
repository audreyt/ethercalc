/**
 * Phase 9 — cron trigger + email handlers.
 *
 * Two wire-level concerns:
 *
 * 1. `upsertCronTriggers(db, row)` — called from the `post-command`
 *    glue when `parseSettimetrigger(cmdstr)` returns non-null. The
 *    legacy flow (src/sc.ls:220-244) replaced the entire comma-list
 *    for a (room, cell) pair each time. We mirror that: delete
 *    existing rows for (room, cell), then insert one row per time.
 *    When `times` is empty the net effect is a delete (clear).
 *
 * 2. `buildEmailSender(env)` — factory that returns a
 *    `BindingEmailSender` when `env.EMAIL` is bound, otherwise a
 *    `StubEmailSender`. Callers never branch on the binding directly;
 *    the factory keeps the business logic environment-agnostic.
 *
 * Pure of `Date.now()` — every helper takes values as arguments.
 * Pure of network — only the D1 binding and the injected sender are
 * touched.

/**
 * Replace the stored trigger set for (room, cell) with `times`. The
 * legacy behavior treats a `settimetrigger` command as "set" semantics
 * — previously stored times for that cell are dropped and the new
 * list takes their place. Empty `times` clears the cell entirely.
 *
 * Implementation: two statements, batched so a partial failure doesn't
 * leave the table half-updated. The DELETE + INSERT ordering matches
 * what the legacy HSET → HDEL flow produced at steady state.
